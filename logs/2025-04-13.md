Decided to go looking for the firmware

Source code talks about:

https://staticpage.ycaviation.com/firmware/ 

From the code, there's a weird conditonal that led me to


https://staticpage.ycaviation.com/firmware/E66C.plist

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
<key>url</key>
<string>
https://staticpage.ycaviation.com/firmware/E66C-APP-DFU-V0.93.zip
</string>
<key>bNo</key>
<string>0</string>
<key>sNo</key>
<string>93</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```


That links works, but I think it's a different device.

Added support for getting the device name, apparently I have the P12C.

No firmware available for that.

I also saw ET210A in the device logs, also a 404.

I think the firmware has been pulled, the HealthWare app also doesn't seem to be able to find anything for updates.
