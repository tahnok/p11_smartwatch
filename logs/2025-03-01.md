Looking at `appRealAllDataFromDevice`. Not called from anywhere else in the app though.

But, it calls sendDataType2Device, so maybe I'm using the wrong UUID?



	sendDataType2Device(770, 12, [i2, type?, length?], 2)

770 is the type (0x0302), understood.
idk what 12 is, but it's a constant
i2 is totally unknown
type seems to be the type. "Real sport from device" is 0, but the `appRealAllDataFromDevice` send 1-5. 
length? it's hard coded to 2 in appRealSportFromDevice, but is between `(1-60) * 60`
idk what 2 is

From `sendDataType2Device`:

12 is the "group type"
2 is the sendPriority (from YCSendBean)


770 is the also known as the dataType.

the `frontQueue` method has some special handling for some dataTypes

`willSendFrame` from YCSendBean I think does some MTU stuff to split a packet up.

sendData2Device takes the dataType (770) and the byte array, so [i2, type, repeat/time] is what we should expect from the packet.

Also, let's verify which gatt char.
