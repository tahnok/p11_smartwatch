> explain why the R.id.ll_start_button is not visible in HeartRateActivity.java

● Task(Find HeartRateActivity.java and check where R.id.ll_start_button is defined and used. If there's a layout  …
      file associated with HeartRateActivity, check that as well to see if ll_start_button has visibility settings.
       Look for any code that might be hiding or showing this button conditionally.)

● The R.id.ll_start_button isn't visible in HeartRateActivity in two specific cases:

  1. When the activity is launched with an "care" intent extra that matches the "care_title" string
  resource. In this case, the code explicitly sets llStartButton.setVisibility(8) (which is GONE in
  Android).
  1. When the connected device doesn't support heart rate functionality. The app checks this with
  YCBTClient.isSupportFunction(Constants.FunctionConstant.ISHATESTHEART) and if it returns false, the
  button is hidden.

  The button is visible by default in other circumstances and when clicked, it launches
  HeartRateMeasureActivity.
