Notes from debugging

We (scott and I) captured the  BLE traffic from android using the hci snoop log. It can be found here: https://cdn.tahnok.ca/u/ecg_reading_ble_snoop.log

If you apply `btatt.service_uuid128 == be:94:00:00:73:33:be:46:b7:ae:68:9e:71:72:2b:d5` as a filter, you can see the communication with the device. First packet might be setting the time, as the first 2 bytes are `01 00` which is `256`, and lines up with a constant called `SettingTime` in the android source code.

Interesting stuff starts when we send `030207000264b7`, which is followed by a few other packets, before eventually getting a LOT of data that's probably the raw ECG data, which all seems to start with `0605`.


BLE packets seem to start with a data type field, `770`, `777`, `779` and a few other seem related to starting an ECG reading.

The EcgMeasureActivity has a method called `openEcgMeasure` that seems to correspond to actually taking a measurement. It does set the wrist (left or right) as well when launched, and this is sent to the device as well, but wasn't looked at yet.

`YCBTClient.appEcgTestStart` does seem to construct a packet with `770` (AppBloodSwitch), with a group type of 10 (called `Group_StartEcgTest`). I think this is the `030207000264b7`, but it is unclear where the rest of the packets come from after that. The android app builds a YCSendBean with a priority of 2. Still not clear what the "body" of the packet consists of. Seems to also involve a 2.

Using `adb logcat` we can see raw ECG data, mention RRI (probably R-R interval). Debug logging gets much better when you turn on the extra logging mode. Found in Mine -> About Us -> Developer Mode. It's the first button to enable it. The second one says something about saving the logs to a text file. Must tap APP version a few times for it to show up (just like enabling debug mode on android).

Some android debugging notes:

- `adb exec-out screencap -p > ecg-details-wesley.png`: capture a screenshot
- `adb logcat --uid 10208` filter logs to just app uid. Found with `adb shell pm list package -U com.yucheng.HealthWear | sed 's/.*uid://'`


Notes about getting a ECG:

- ECG didn't always start when you clicked the button. Relaunching the page, or toggling bluetooth seems to fix it. When it works, the watch will switch to a screen with PPG on it and `--`. Once you place your finger on the electrode, it should eventually show `ECG` on the watch and say "the electrode contact is good".
- The electrode connection seemed flaky. It didn't always work, even when pushing hard and making a good contact. Don't know if there's a "trick" but it wasn't fool proof. Maybe a drop of water on the electrode?
