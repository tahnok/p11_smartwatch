Ok, so I tried sending what I thought were the 3 packets from 

`YCBTClientImpl.getInstance().sendDataType2Device(Constants.DATATYPE.AppBloodSwitch, 10, new byte[]{2}, 2, bleDataResponse);`,

I figured out that there 2 arg is the GroupType and it seems like it's used as a kind of state / market variable that is used in YCBTClientImpl's callbacks (like packetAppControlHandle) to like... do a multi packet exchange. My trace through the code / from the packet capture I can see:

```
570,phone,CONTROL[3],BLOOD_TEST[2],770,02
575,watch,CONTROL[3],BLOOD_TEST[2],770,02
577,phone,CONTROL[3],WAVE_UPLOAD[11],779,0101
581,watch,CONTROL[3],WAVE_UPLOAD[11],779,00
584,phone,CONTROL[3],REAL_DATA[9],777,010302
587,watch,CONTROL[3],REAL_DATA[9],777,00
590,phone,CONTROL[3],WAVE_UPLOAD[11],779,0100
593,watch,CONTROL[3],WAVE_UPLOAD[11],779,00
```

so 030202, 030b0101, 0309010302, 030b0100 which....

Does the thing! It starts streaming ECG data to the UUID_BULK = "be940003-7333-be46-b7ae-689e71722bd5"

Not sure if it also sends heart rate and / or PPG.
