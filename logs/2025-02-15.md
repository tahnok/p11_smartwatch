Want real time PPG or heart rate

first byte is often 3, but maybe realtime is 6?

`06000c009a01210111004e27` is from the snoop log of ECG, but doesn't do anything when sent (and it's a response not a request).

`0502060043fc` also didn't go anything obvious, but got a response `bytearray(b'\x05\x02\x08\x00\x00\x00Q\x8c')` 

`beefcafe` got no response.

Tried using claude to write some sample code to request/parse PPG data but it seems kind of inconsistent / hallucinated. Some interesting ideas about the packet structure, but I suspect nothing in the app actually asks for raw PPG... maybe during the ECG stuff though. I'm concerned there's some JNI stuff happening that will be opaque to me.

Trying to send `b'\x03\x0b\x08\x00\x01\x01\xdc\x8a'` and `030b08000100fd9a` both result in the same response `b'\x03\x0b\x07\x00\x00Qd'`.  This is 'AppControlWave'

Also need to consider `AppControlReal` (777)

I have `03090900010002a0de` from the logs to try

(Note: working better with random USB bluetooth dongle, but every other connect fails to discover services)

Got back

```
be940001-7333-be46-b7ae-689e71722bd5 rx: bytearray(b'\x03\t\x07\x00\x009\x89')
be940003-7333-be46-b7ae-689e71722bd5 rx: bytearray(b'\x06\x00\x0c\x00\xf1\x01[\x01\x15\x00\xee]')
```

No obvious measurement from device though.
