Ok, so any combination in the data field of 0 and 1 results in

`032f0700fc7db7`

theory: this mode isn't supported by the watch given it's features

Instead, let's try something else

HomeFragment calls syncRealData with a 1 or a 0. 0 is only sent on pause, so probably means stop? Let's try 1, although it's weird it's sent when syncing finishes...

Actually, let's go simple. There's a battery level call I see. It pulls it out of shared preferences, which means it's probably called early.  DataUnpack.java has a unpackDeviceInfoData that is interesting, but not clear what packet triggers it.

Does say datatype is 512, which is GetDeviceInfo in the constants file...

```java
    public static void getDeviceInfo(BleDataResponse bleDataResponse) {  
        YCBTClientImpl.getInstance().sendSingleData2Device(512, new byte[]{71, 67}, 2, bleDataResponse);  
    }
```

That will do

I think 2 is the priority, so we can ignore it. That means we should try sending 512, 71,67 as a packet now.

That worked!

got back `02001e0075000601005b000100030000000001000000000008000000a3f1`

And I think it parses! I have to trim the first 4 bytes (datatype, length) but then I can feed the data to and the battery level looks "right", although I did just watch it go from 91 to 93...
